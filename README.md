#Leaderboard project

#Authors: Jacob O'Dell, Austin Anderson, Zeb Cunningham, Matthew Willis


This project is made to take student's information from an excel file, and display a leaderboard of grades

The student and course information may be retrieved through the command line, as well as ID lists.

A graphical interface is also included with the ability for users to look up the top performing students.
The interface is a bar graph, and each bar can be clicked on to see a student's information.
